# Geometric Model

## Overview

The geometric model adopted in CSF is intentionally explicit and minimal.  
All sectional properties are derived from **user-defined geometry**, without predefined templates or implicit assumptions.

CSF represents the geometry of a non-prismatic member as a **ruled solid** generated by interpolating polygonal cross-sections along a longitudinal axis \( z \).

This chapter defines the geometric assumptions, constraints, and rules that govern this representation.

---

## Reference System

CSF adopts a **local Cartesian reference system**:

- The **\( z \)-axis** coincides with the member longitudinal axis.
- Cross-sections are defined in planes **normal to \( z \)**.
- Each section is described in a local **\( x\text{–}y \)** plane.

Two (or more) reference sections are placed at prescribed coordinates:
- start section at \( z = z_0 \),
- end section at \( z = z_1 \) (typically \( z_1 = L \)).

All section geometries must be expressed in the **same \( x\text{–}y \) orientation**.  
Relative rotation between sections is not supported in the current formulation.

---

## Section Definition

A section is defined as a **collection of closed polygonal regions**.

Each polygon represents a **material or void subdomain** of the cross-section.

### Polygon Rules

For a polygon to be valid in CSF, it must satisfy the following conditions:

1. **Closed polyline**  
   The polygon is implicitly closed; the first vertex must not be repeated.

2. **Counter-clockwise orientation (CCW)**  
   Vertices must be ordered counter-clockwise.  
   This is a strict requirement to ensure correct sign conventions when applying Green’s theorem for area and inertia computation.

3. **No self-intersection**  
   Polygons must be simple and non-self-intersecting.

4. **Planar geometry**  
   All vertices lie in the same \( x\text{–}y \) plane.

Violation of these rules results in invalid geometry and must be corrected upstream.

---

## Multi-Polygon Sections

A single section may contain **multiple polygons**, allowing the representation of:

- hollow sections,
- multi-cell geometries,
- composite layouts,
- embedded components.

Each polygon is treated as an independent geometric region with its own attributes.

Containment relationships (one polygon inside another) are interpreted as **geometric nesting**, not as overlapping material.

---

## Polygon Identity and Correspondence

For interpolation along \( z \), polygons defined at different reference sections must be **topologically consistent**.

This means:
- the same number of polygons must exist at each reference section,
- polygons are matched **by creation order**, not by geometric proximity.

Polygon names are used for **tracking and assignment of physical laws**, but **do not define geometric pairing**.  
Geometric correspondence is purely positional in the polygon list.

This design choice avoids ambiguity and ensures deterministic interpolation.

---

## Ruled-Surface Interpolation

The 3D geometry of the member is generated through **ruled surfaces**.

For each polygon vertex \( P_i \), the spatial position along the member is defined as:

\[
P_i(z) = P_{i,0} + \frac{z - z_0}{z_1 - z_0} \left( P_{i,1} - P_{i,0} \right)
\]

where:
- \( P_{i,0} \) is the vertex at the start section,
- \( P_{i,1} \) is the corresponding vertex at the end section.

This produces:
- linear interpolation of vertex coordinates,
- planar quadrilateral surface patches between corresponding edges,
- a geometrically continuous volume without intermediate discretization.

---

## Geometric Continuity

The ruled-surface formulation guarantees:

- **\( C^0 \)** continuity of the geometry,
- deterministic and reproducible intermediate sections,
- absence of geometric oscillations or smoothing artifacts.

Curvature of outlines is approximated by increasing the number of polygon vertices.  
No spline or higher-order geometric interpolation is performed.

---

## Intermediate Sections

An intermediate section at any coordinate \( z \in [z_0, z_1] \) is obtained by:

1. evaluating the interpolated position of all vertices,
2. reconstructing each polygon at that location,
3. assembling the section as a set of polygons identical in topology to the reference sections.

This operation is purely geometric and independent of material or stiffness considerations.

---

## Topological Constraints

The following constraints apply to all CSF geometries:

- Polygon topology must remain unchanged along \( z \).
- Polygon vertex count must be constant between reference sections.
- Creation order must be consistent.
- Holes and voids must be explicitly modeled as polygons.

Topology changes along the member (e.g. merging or splitting regions) are outside the current scope.

---

## Geometric Accuracy and User Responsibility

CSF does not attempt to “fix” or regularize geometry.

- No automatic orientation correction is applied.
- No vertex reordering is performed.
- No tolerance-based cleanup is introduced.

Geometric correctness is a **user responsibility**.  
This strict policy avoids hidden corrections and preserves modeling transparency.

---

## Summary

The CSF geometric model is based on a small set of explicit and verifiable rules:

- polygonal cross-sections,
- consistent topology,
- ruled-surface interpolation,
- strict orientation and ordering constraints.

This approach prioritizes determinism, reproducibility, and clarity over geometric convenience, forming a stable foundation for continuous sectional analysis.
