# From the Physical Problem to the CUF Model

## I want to analyse this beam. What do I need to decide?

Before thinking about input files or software commands, separate the few choices that define the analysis.

### 1. What is the beam?

Define:

- **geometry**
- **material**
- possible **variation along the beam**

### 2. What is the problem?

Define:

- **loads**
- **boundary conditions**

### 3. How do I represent the solution?

Here we adopt **CUF**.

Choose:

- the **transverse expansion**
- the **expansion order**
- the **longitudinal finite-element approximation**

In CUF, the transverse functions approximate the displacement over the cross-section, while the finite-element shape functions approximate it along the beam axis.

### 4. How do these parts work together?

They are **independent components that communicate with each other**.

Geometry and materials describe the beam. Loads and boundary conditions describe the problem. CUF describes the displacement approximation.

**CUF does not incorporate these components: it queries them for the information required by the analysis.**

That is the basic organization. Now we can build the first example.
