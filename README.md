# Continuous Section Field (CSF)
## An Analytical Engine for Non-Prismatic Structural Members

**CSF** is a Python library for the geometric and mechanical modeling of **single non-prismatic structural members** (slender beams with variable cross-sections).
### **Arbitrary Cross-Section Support**
Unlike traditional structural tools limited to predefined geometric templates, this library treats the cross-section as a **fully generic topological entity**.

* **Algebraic Polygon Logic:** Sections are defined as a collection of vertices in a 2D plane. By utilizing **weighted vertex logic**, the engine can compute properties for any shape, from standard circular towers to complex, custom-engineered architectural profiles.
* ** Curvature:** While the model uses discrete segments, it supports an arbitrary number of sides. You can approximate curved surfaces (like the NREL tower) by increasing the vertex count, effectively reducing the segment length to reach any desired level of precision.
* **No Predefined Templates:** You are not restricted to "Circle" or "Rectangle" classes. If a geometry can be described by coordinates, the library can compute its structural mechanics ($A, I, J, Q$).
* **Topological Freedom:** The algebraic approach allows for seamless modeling of:
    * **Hollow Sections:** (e.g., the NREL tapered shell).
    * **Multi-cellular Shapes:** Complex internal stiffeners or multi-chamber profiles.
    * **Composite Logic:** Potential for multi-material sections by applying modular ratio weights to different polygons.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Not a FEM Solver**: This library is **not** a Finite Element Method (FEM) software. It is a geometric and constitutive "engine" designed to model the continuous variation of a single member. It provides the stiffness matrices and sectional properties required for structural analysis, acting as a high-accuracy pre-processor or a kernel for beam theory applications.

## 1. Theoretical Framework: Overcoming Discretization Dependence
The common practice of modeling non-prismatic members as a concatenation of equivalent prismatic elements (**piecewise-prismatic approach**) introduces a non-neutral methodological choice. The numerical solution varies with the number of subdivisions and the location of sampling points.

**CSF** treats the single member as a **continuous manifold** using **ruled surfaces**. By defining the member’s geometry through explicit analytical functions (linear interpolation of vertices), the library ensures that:
* The structural response is an intrinsic property of the geometry.
* Physical properties (Area, Inertia) are defined at every infinitesimal coordinate $z$.
* Arbitrariness is confined exclusively to the solver level, ensuring reproducibility.

## 2. Key Features

### Ruled Surfaces and Vertex Interpolation

The 3D volume is generated by connecting a **Start** section at $z_{start}$ and an **End** section at $z_{end}$ using **ruled surfaces**.

For each vertex $P_i$, the generator line is defined as:

$$
P_i(z) = P_{i,start} + \frac{z - z_{start}}{z_{end} - z_{start}} \cdot (P_{i,end} - P_{i,start})
$$

**Geometric results**:
- **Linear Interpolation**: Each vertex of the cross-section is described as a linear function of the longitudinal coordinate.
- **Rules Surfaces**: This mapping creates ruled surfaces that define a smooth variation of the section, making vertex coordinates polynomial functions of known degree.
- **Continuous taper**: smooth transition between different shapes (e.g. tapered T-beams, conical tubes)
- **Continuous properties**: $A(z)$, $I(z)$, $EA(z)$, $EI(z)$, $GJ(z)$ defined analytically along the entire axis


### The Role of Polygons: Homogenization & Voids
Polygons in CSF are the fundamental units for both geometry and mechanics:
* **Multi-material sections**: Each polygon carries a `weight` attribute ($n = E_i / E_{ref}$). This allows the modeling of composite sections (e.g., steel-reinforced timber) by calculating the **Elastic Centroid**.
* **Hole Modeling (Algebraic Voids)**: By assigning a **weight of -1.0**, a polygon acts as a hole. The library automatically subtracts its area and inertia from the total, allowing for effortless modeling of hollow tubes or cellular beams without complex boolean operations.

### Advanced Property Digestor
For any point $z$ along the axis, the library calculates:
* **Sectional Stiffness Matrix ($3 \times 3$)**: Rigorous coupling of axial and flexural stiffness ($EA, EI_x, EI_y, EI_{xy}$) via Gaussian Quadrature over triangulated domains.
* **Shear Analysis (Jourawski)**: Calculation of the **Partial Statical Moment ($Q$)** using a polygon clipping algorithm, enabling shear stress analysis on variable sections.
* **Volumetric Analysis**: Exact material volume calculation via integration of the area function $A(z)$.

## 3. Comprehensive Mechanical Property Digest

The library performs a multi-pass integration to extract every relevant structural parameter. All values are calculated at any coordinate $z$ and account for homogenization (weights) and voids (negative weights).

### A. Geometric & Mass Properties (Zeroth & First Moments)
These define the "quantity" and "position" of the section.
* **Weighted Area ($A$):** The homogenized net area $\sum A_i \cdot w_i$.
* **Elastic Centroid ($C_x, C_y$):** The center of stiffness relative to the global origin.
* **Total Volume ($V$):** The 3D integral of the area function $A(z)$ along the longitudinal axis.
* **Section Perimeter ($P$):** Total length of all polygon boundaries, used for surface-related calculations.

### B. Stiffness & Inertia (Second Moments)
Calculated relative to the **Centroidal Axes** via the Parallel Axis Theorem.
* **Centroidal Moments of Inertia ($I_{xx}, I_{yy}$):** Resistance to bending about horizontal and vertical axes.
* **Product of Inertia ($I_{xy}$):** Measure of sectional asymmetry; essential for unsymmetrical bending.
* **Polar Moment of Area ($J$):** Resistance to torsional deformation, calculated as $I_{xx} + I_{yy}$.
* **Sectional Stiffness Matrix ($[K]$):** A $3 \times 3$ constitutive matrix relating generalized strains ($\epsilon, \kappa_x, \kappa_y$) to internal actions ($N, M_x, M_y$).



### C. Derived & Principal Properties
Calculated via Mohr's Circle analysis for structural stability and orientation.
* **Principal Moments of Inertia ($I_1, I_2$):** The maximum and minimum possible second moments of area.
* **Principal Rotation Angle ($\theta$):** The inclination of the principal axes relative to the global system.
* **Radii of Gyration ($r_x, r_y$):** Measure of efficiency for buckling analysis, defined as $\sqrt{I/A}$.

### D. Strength & Shear Analysis
Properties used for stress verification at specific fibers.
* **Elastic Section Moduli ($W_x, W_y$):** Calculated using the extreme fiber distances ($y_{max}, y_{min}$) to find the maximum bending stress $\sigma = M/W$.
* **Extreme Fiber Distances:** The maximum distances from the neutral axis to the outer vertices of the polygons.
* **Partial Statical Moment ($Q$):** Calculated for the portion above a cut $y_{cut}$ using the **Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm**; required for Jourawski shear stress ($\tau = VQ/It$).

## Target Applications & Use Cases

**CSF** is designed for specialist engineering scenarios where standard "piecewise-prismatic" approximations are insufficient or inefficient.

### 🌬️ Wind Energy (Offshore & Onshore)
High-fidelity modeling of tapered steel or concrete towers. Since CSF captures the continuous variation of the section, it provides more accurate natural frequency (eigenvalue) analysis and mass distribution, which are critical for aero-elastic stability.
* **Benefit**: Reduces the number of elements needed for a full tower model while increasing precision.

### 🌉 Complex Infrastructure & Bridges
Ideal for bridge piers with non-standard geometries (e.g., transitioning from a rectangular base to a circular or elliptical top) or bridge decks with variable depth.
* **Benefit**: Exact stiffness matrix generation for "Organic" or non-catalog shapes.

### 🎓 Academic Research & Software Development
A "plug-and-play" mechanical engine for researchers developing new FEM codes, non-linear solvers, or optimization algorithms.
* **Benefit**: Avoids rewriting the complex geometric integration and statical moment logic from scratch.

To verify the accuracy of the numerical engine, a validation test was performed using a **non-tapered hollow cylinder** (Steel Pipe). This allows for a direct comparison between the library's results (based on weighted polygons) and exact analytical formulas.

The test script `cilinder_withcheck.py` models a tower with a diameter of 4.935m and a thickness of 23mm using a 128-sided polygon. The results demonstrate that the polygonal approximation converges to the analytical solution with exceptional precision.

### Scientific Observation
The alignment between the CSF results and the NREL data is nearly perfect. Small discrepancies (e.g., in mass or inertia) are due to the fact that NREL data is often rounded for publication, while CSF maintains double-precision accuracy throughout its internal integration of the ruled surface. This comparison confirms the library's ability to accurately handle **continuously varying tapered sections** in high-stakes engineering applications.
