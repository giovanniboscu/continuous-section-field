# CSF Programming Examples


The files here demonstrate how to interact with CSF **directly via Python code** (programmatic API usage), moving beyond the YAML-driven workflows.

## Purpose

The files here are intended to show how to use CSF **from Python code** (API/programmatic usage), not only through YAML-driven workflows.

Use these examples if you want to:

- import CSF modules in your own scripts
- build sections and fields directly in Python
- run calculations from code
- generate outputs programmatically
- integrate CSF into custom pipelines/tools

## What these examples are

- Practical code snippets for developers
- Reference patterns for API usage
- Starting points for custom automation

## What these examples are not

- End-user tutorials for non-programmers
- Full CLI-only workflows
- Production templates to copy blindly without review

## Suggested workflow

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install CSF in editable mode.
3. Open one example and run it.
4. Adapt it to your geometry/material/action logic.

## Notes

- Keep these examples focused and minimal.
- Prefer explicit parameters over hidden defaults.
- Validate your model inputs before running analyses.
