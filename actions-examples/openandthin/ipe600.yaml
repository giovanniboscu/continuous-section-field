# NOTE:
# This IPE section is modeled as a single closed polygon ("ipe600"), i.e. one solid contour.
# In this representation there are no separate wall parts (web/flanges) tagged with @wall.
# Therefore the @wall torsional workflow is not applicable here.
#
# Why:
# - @wall expects explicit wall polygons (e.g., web@wall, top_flange@wall, bottom_flange@wall),
#   each representing a thin-walled component with its own thickness (optionally @t=...).
# - A single closed polygon does not provide that decomposition, so wall-by-wall thin-wall
#   Saint-Venant evaluation cannot be defined consistently from this input alone.
#
# Practical consequence:
# - Keep this geometry as a "single-polygon solid example" for generic section properties.
# - If you want to use J_sv_wall, rebuild the same profile as multiple polygons and tag them @wall.
