# Minimal mixed-pattern geometry for quick checks
# Units: meters
# Goal: very simple, symmetric, easy to sanity-check
#
# Included tags:
# - left_web@wall@t=...
# - right_web@wall@t=...
# - inner_cell@cell@t=...
#
# Notes:
# - The two wall polygons are identical rectangles (left/right), symmetric about y-axis.
# - The cell polygon is a centered rectangle (closed contour).
# - S0 and S1 are identical (constant along z) to simplify debugging.
