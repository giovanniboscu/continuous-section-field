# Design Function (Core Assumption)

In CSF, longitudinal variation is treated as a *design function*.
A design function satisfies all of the following:

1. **Defined before the calculation**  
   The function exists independently of any numerical solution process and is established prior to running the solver.

2. **Declared by the user**  
   The function is explicitly specified by the designer, not implicitly assumed or generated by the software.

3. **Has explicit parameters**  
   Its formulation is parametric, with clearly identifiable inputs (e.g. geometric parameters, material properties, spatial variables).

4. **Independent of the solver**  
   The function does not depend on a specific numerical algorithm, discretization strategy, or internal implementation of a solver.

5. **Reusable**  
   The function can be reused consistently for:
   - analytical calculations,
   - comparison between alternative designs,
   - documentation and traceability of design assumptions.
