# Design Function (Core Assumption)

In CSF, longitudinal variation is treated as a *design function*.
A design function satisfies all of the following:

1. **Defined before the calculation**  
   The function exists independently of any numerical solution process and is established prior to running the solver.

2. **Declared by the user**  
   The function is explicitly specified by the designer, not implicitly assumed or generated by the software.

3. **Has explicit parameters**  
   Its formulation is parametric, with clearly identifiable inputs (e.g. geometric parameters, material properties, spatial variables).

4. **Independent of the solver**  
   The function does not depend on a specific numerical algorithm, discretization strategy, or internal implementation of a solver.

5. **Reusable**  
   The function can be reused consistently for:
   - analytical calculations,
   - comparison between alternative designs,
   - documentation and traceability of design assumptions.

criteria **3–5** of the Design Function definition,
showing how they are satisfied by CSF in a concrete and inspectable way.

## 3. Has Explicit Parameters

**Question:**  
Are the parameters explicit and inspectable?

### In CSF, the parameters are explicit:

- Vertex coordinates (polygonal section geometry)
- Longitudinal axis *z*
- Interpolation parameters (e.g. ruled / piecewise rules)
- Longitudinal functions *w(z)* (material, stiffness, weights)

### As a result, everything is:

- **Readable**
- **Serializable**
- **Documentable**

No parameter is implicit, hidden, or solver-generated.

## 4. Independent of the Solver

**Question:**  
Does the function exist independently of the solver?

### In CSF:

- Section properties *(A(z), I(z), J(z))* can be computed **without any solver**
- The same definition can be exported to **multiple solvers**
- The model does **not** depend on:
  - solver discretization
  - numerical integration schemes
  - internal solver implementations

The solver is a consumer, not the owner, of the function.

---

## 5. Reusable

**Question:**  
Is the function reusable?

### The same function can be reused consistently for:

- Preliminary sizing (predimensioning)
- Comparison between alternative designs
- Validation and cross-checking
- Technical documentation and traceability
- Repeated export to different structural solvers

Reuse does not require redefining or reinterpreting the model.

---

## Summary

Criteria **3–5** confirm that CSF treats longitudinal variation
as a **true design function**, not as a numerical side effect.

The function is explicit, solver-independent, and reusable by construction.
