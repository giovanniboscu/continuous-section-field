# 02 - Plotting Sections and Volume

## Introduction

After verifying section properties programmatically, the next step is visual validation.

This chapter focuses on plotting workflows that help confirm geometry, interpolation quality, and model consistency along `z`.  
The goal is practical: quickly detect modeling mistakes before downstream structural analysis.

You will use plotting to inspect:

- section shape at selected stations,
- geometric evolution along the member axis,
- full volume representation from `S0` to `S1`,
- side-by-side comparisons between stations.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a repeatable plotting workflow for debugging and validating CSF models directly from Python API calls.
